      An ever-evolving, very opinionated architecture and dev environment for
      new Vue SPA projects using Vue CLI.

      Boilerplates are pre-configured projects, that are meant to give a good
      head start when building larger applications. They tend follow best
      practices for the technologies that they incorporate, with the better ones
      keeping a good, up to date documentation on how to use and extend them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bad part about boilerplates is that once you start developing on top of
      one, it is hard to keep track of its future updates, as you have to apply
      them manually.
